![mice were rather afraid of Ginger](./Lillian_grayp14.png)

##Butikken fikk besøk av mus, men musene var ganske redde for Ginger.

##Ginger pleide å si "Pickles, kan du snakke med de musene? Jeg får alltid vann i munnen".

##"I cannot bear," sa Ginger "å se dem trippe ut av døra med de små godteposene sine. Trip, tripp tripp."










##The shop was also patronized by mice—only the mice were rather afraid of Ginger.

##Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water.

##"I cannot bear," said he, "to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels."
