##Blooddy well find them and lock them up! They fired their cannons at the teather and made it burn! Ah what a beautiful bicyle! I will take that. Says Juli "Mad" Gold and bicycles around deck.



And then row for the bridge.


##Throw off the lines! Time to go! Carrot shouts and Ginger and Pickles unties the row boat sending it to the water with a spalsh

##Row you animals! Rooow! Carrot shouts.
