##Mange kunder kom hver eneste dag og kjøpte masse ting, særlig godteri. Men ingen hadde noen penger, de betalte aldri for en eneste pose med smågodt.

##Salget var enormt, ti ganger så mye salg som Tabitha Twitchit sitt salg.

##The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers. But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints.

##But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.
